    /**
     Helper method for unit testing code that involves cache data.
     - Parameters:
        - date: The reference date for apply events. Defaults to a date representing 1000 seconds since January 1, 1970.
        - resolveEventCount: The number of resolve events to include in the prefilled data. Defaults to 1.
        - applyEventCount: The number of apply events to include in the prefilled data. Defaults to 3.
     - Throws: An error if any issues occur during the creation of the prefilled data.
     - Returns: The prefilled data as an instance of `Data`.
     - Note:`applyEventCount` takes an effect on all every resolve events.
